  token holders to engage in on-chain advertising. The
  system is going to strategically send tokens to
  individuals who have yet to possess them, creating a new

    Last objective for Stage 1 is to finely tune the
    efficiency of ERC20 standards and potentially integrate
    some elements from GameFi concepts to it.{"\n"}This process
    aims to minimize gas consumption expenses, 
    counterbalancing the elevated costs associated with
    proxy implementation and the utilization of upgradable
    patterns.{"\n"} By doing the above said the final milestone is
    reaching a decent ERC20 token presence, not only in
    major but also numerous minor chains.
